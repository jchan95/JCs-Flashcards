AI Flashcards - Complete App Summary
Overview
A spaced repetition flashcard app using the SM-2 (SuperMemo-2) algorithm for efficient memorization. Cards are uploaded via CSV and are read-only in the app.

Data Structures
Card Data (3 fields)
{
  id: string;           // Unique identifier
  term: string;         // Front of card (question)
  definition: string;   // Back of card (answer)
  visualMetaphor: string; // Memory hint shown during review
}
Card Progress (SM-2 tracking)
{
  cardId: string;
  easinessFactor: number;    // Starts at 2.5, min 1.3 (lower = harder)
  interval: number;          // Days until next review
  repetitions: number;       // Successful reviews in a row
  lastReviewDate: string | null;
  nextDueDate: string;       // When card is due
}
App Stats
{
  totalReviews: number;
  correctReviews: number;    // Quality >= 3 counts as correct
  currentStreak: number;     // Consecutive days studied
  longestStreak: number;
  lastReviewDate: string | null;
}
SM-2 Algorithm Implementation
Quality Ratings (0-5)
Rating	Label	Description
0	Blackout	Complete blackout
1	Wrong	Wrong, but recognized
2	Familiar	Wrong, but familiar
3	Hard	Correct with difficulty
4	Good	Correct with hesitation
5	Perfect	Perfect, instant recall
Core Algorithm
function calculateSM2(progress, quality) {
  if (quality < 3) {
    // Failed - reset to beginning
    repetitions = 0;
    interval = 1;
  } else {
    // Passed - update easiness factor
    easinessFactor = EF + (0.1 - (5 - quality) * (0.08 + (5 - quality) * 0.02));
    easinessFactor = Math.max(easinessFactor, 1.3); // Minimum 1.3
    
    repetitions += 1;
    
    // Set interval
    if (repetitions === 1) interval = 1;
    else if (repetitions === 2) interval = 6;
    else interval = Math.round(interval * easinessFactor);
  }
  
  nextDueDate = today + interval days;
}
Card Ordering
Due cards: Sorted by easiness factor (lowest/hardest first)
New cards: Randomized each session
Review cards shown before new cards
Mastery Levels
Level	Criteria
New	Never reviewed
Learning	< 3 successful reviews
Review	3+ reviews, still practicing
Mastered	EF > 2.5 AND interval >= 21 days
Features
Review Screen
Shows term (front), tap to reveal definition (back)
"Show Hint" button reveals visual metaphor
6 rating buttons (0-5) after revealing answer
Progress indicator: "X reviewed, Y remaining"
Study More: After completing due cards, can review ALL cards again

Data Management
Cards loaded from server (GET /api/cards)
Progress stored in localStorage (browser) or AsyncStorage (mobile)
Stats persist across sessions
"Reset Progress" clears all learning data but keeps cards
Backend API
Endpoint	Method	Description
/api/cards	GET	Fetch all flashcards
/api/cards	POST	Upload cards (array)
/api/cards	DELETE	Clear all cards
Cards stored in data/cards.json on server.

Design
Primary: Forest green (#2C5F4A)
Accent: Warm amber (#E8A468)
Background: Warm off-white (#F9F7F4)
Success: Green for correct/streaks
Error: Red for resets/failures
Key Files to Port
SM-2 logic: client/lib/sm2.ts - algorithm, CSV parsing, card ordering
Storage logic: client/lib/storage.ts - progress/stats persistence (adapt for localStorage)
Card data: data/cards.json - your 52 flashcards
This gives you everything needed to rebuild as a PWA. The SM-2 algorithm and storage logic can be copied almost directly - just swap AsyncStorage for localStorage.
